  text: Welcome to Vault Sixty-Eight, a place that could use a woman's touch. One
    lady plus a thousand men to play with, but it seems I may have played with them
    too much...  Please save me from Vault Forty-Three! A panther's been put here
    by mistake! It's wild and it's vicious, and thinks I smell delicious! Good thing
    Vault tech's unlikely to break-  So seal the door and stay inside 'Til hope's
    no more and all your dreams have died!  Yes, life in vaults is quite a curse,
    but Vault-Tec tells us all the fallout's surely worse!  Greetings, my Vault Dweller
    friends! I'm king and commander of this vault! You may say I'm just a lonely psycho,
    but if I kill you, it's all the puppet's fault...  I'm Gary from Vault One-Oh-Eight.
    That's Gary, also Gary.  They're my clones. There used to be non-Garies, but things
    got a little hairy... Now I'm stuck here with these Garies all alone!  So seal
    the door and lock it tight! There's Ghouls galore and ghastly things that bite!  We're
    safe from all nuclear assault! So just surrender all your aspirations, and embrace
    exasperation with your newfound life inside a vault!  And the fallout's surely
    worse!
